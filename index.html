                 <hr>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A muffin is an individual-sized, baked product. It can refer to two distinct items, a part-raised flatbread that is baked and then cooked on a griddle (typically unsweetened) and a cupcake-like quickbread (often sweetened) that is chemically leavened and then baked in a mold. While quickbread muffins are often sweetened, there are savory varieties made with ingredients such as corn and cheese. The flatbread is of British or European derivation, and dates from at least the early 18th century, while the quickbread originated in North America during the 19th century. Both are common worldwide today.

                 <hr>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Dhokla is a vegetarian culinary dish that is found mainly in the Indian state of Gujarat and parts of adjacent states. It is made with a fermented batter derived from rice, ground urad dal, and chickpea flour. Dhokla can be eaten for breakfast, as a main course, as a side dish, or as a snack. Dhokla is very similar to Khaman, however Dhokla is made of batter derived from mixture of rice flour and chickpea flour, whereas Khaman is typically made from Chickpeas gram and looks yellow in color. Khaman has become widely popular outside Gujarat but is misunderstood or incorrectly known as Dhokla.

                    Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, but other types of batters can also be used. Various toppings and flavorings are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate, or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors.
